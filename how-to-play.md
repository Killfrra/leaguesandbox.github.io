_(based on `#information` section in [Discord](https://discord.gg/cbucHb4q))_

1. Download and install launcher from [leagues4.com](https://leagues4.com/)

2. Download and unpack game itself:<br/>
[Scrubbed, easely moddable version (.7z 2.7 GB) from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JVUGe75nMluczrY14xb0KDXiihFRlGnV)<br/>
or
[Unscrubbed, packed version (.tar.gz 3.42 GB) from Mega](https://mega.nz/#!hpkiQK5A!pFkZJtxCMQktJf4umplAdPC_Fukt0xgMfO7g3bGp1Io)

6. Launch the launcher, register, provide the path to the league executable when asked. It lies in...<br/>
`...\RADS\solutions\lol_game_client_sln\releases\0.0.1.68\deploy\League of Legends.exe`

> Tip: Don't waste your time waiting in queue, there is a 99% chance you won't find a match. You better create a custom game.

> Note: Many champions don't work properly. Here is the [list](https://discord.com/channels/472169314913353730/845275867600257025/854461377770029086). Try Ezreal.
